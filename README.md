### Description
Created a translator from a random string input to an optimized Brainfuck code. Actually, my code is made for the Brainfuck code to take the less space possible but I would love to receive advices for the code to be more efficient.

### Use Project
The only package used by my code is the math package.
You can launch it by executing the command line below in the folder where the file is stored (for that you'll need to have python in PATH, if you don't, go check this [link](https://www.educative.io/edpresso/how-to-add-python-to-path-variable-in-windows)).
```
python MindBlower.py
```
If you want you can pass all you text in uppercase by adding !uppercase in front of your string same for lowercase (!lowercase).

If you need it here's the syntax of the main function :
```
MindBlower(input, uppercase = False, lowercase = False)
```

Unfortunately for now I can't host the python code but you can run it by clicking the link on *View Project* or on this [compiler](https://www.jdoodle.com/python3-programming-online/) by copying and paste my code and add your input in *Stdin Inputs*
