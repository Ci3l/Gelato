### Description
Created a translator from random a string input to a Brainfuck code. It's optimised to take the less space possible.

Unfortunately for now I can't host the python code but you can run it on this [compiler](https://www.jdoodle.com/python3-programming-online/) by copying and paste my code and add your input in *Stdin Inputs*
